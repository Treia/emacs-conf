# emacs-conf
This is my emacs configuration. I keep it neatly organised in an org-mode file.

Tested using Emacs 25 on Arch Linux

You can run make to byte-compile the configuration files for faster start-up
but don't forget to recompile if you modify myconf.org or changes won't take effect.

If you want a good emacs config you should probably check out the brilliant 
[doom-emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) by hlissner instead. I'm just doing my own config for learning purposes.
